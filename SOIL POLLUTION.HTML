<FONT FACE="Corbel" SIZE="3" COLOR="SKYBLUE"> <P>Soil pollution was introduction into the environment of substances that don't normally belong there,which,in great enough concentrations, can have harmful effects on plant's animal and Humans.We can defined land pollution either narrowly or broadly.Narrowly defined,it's another term for soil contamination(for example,by factory chemicals or sewage and other wastewater).In this article,we'll define it more widely to incultural pesticides and fertilizers,impacts from mining and other forms of industry,the unwanted consequences of urbanization to mean any kind of long-term land damage, destruction, degradation, or loss.</P>
<P>There are many different ways of permanently changing the land,from soil contamination (poisoning by chemicals or waste) to general urbanization (the systematic creation of cities and other human settlements from greenfield,virgin factories and offices,in our homes and schools, and in such unlikely places as hospitals.Even the most sophisticated waste processing plants , which use "plasma torches" (electrically controlled"flames" at temperatures of thousands of degrees)to turn waste into gas, produce solid waste products that have to be disposed of somehow .there's simply no getting away from waste products that have to be burned or buried!</P></FONT>
